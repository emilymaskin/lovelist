	<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
	<p>
		Through Time Inc. publications, websites, and other media, you can order 
		products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, 
		subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or 
		participate in one of our online forums or communities. You are able to visit 
		much of this website and enjoy many Time Inc. publications and promotions without 
		providing any personally identifiable information. Sometimes, however, we do need 
		your personally identifiable information to provide you with the products and 
		services that you request. The types of personally identifiable information that 
		may be collected at these pages and elsewhere include, but are not limited to: 
		name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, 
		and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and 
		services.
	</p>
	<p>
		At some Time Inc. sites and through certain promotions, you can submit information about 
		other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an 
		electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly 
		to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally 
		identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: 
		recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For certain promotions, only persons who provide us with the requested personally 
		identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or 
		otherwise participate in the promotion's activities and offerings. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many 
		of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system 
		you are using, and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
	</p>
	<h3>How We Use the Information</h3>
	<p>
		We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our 
		products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to 
		offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 
		We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you 
		have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a 
		request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us. 
		We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or 
		cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or 
		services to them. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish 
		your name, screen name, and other information you have provided to us. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to 
		provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these 
		online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. 
		We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design 
		and content of our publications and websites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. 
		We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, 
		programs, or services. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a 
		court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's 
		request. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Agents and contractors of Time Inc. who have access to personally identifiable information are required 
		to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not 
		using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Time Inc. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We may transfer your personally identifiable information to other Time Inc. offices for internal management 
		and administrative purposes. Your personal data will be transferred to other Time Inc. offices where necessary 
		for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit. Transfers of 
		personally identifiable information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense 
		of legal claims. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot 
		assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that 
		is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties 
		misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves 
		for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.
	</p>
